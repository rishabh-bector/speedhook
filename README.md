# Speedhook
A chrome extension which hooks into existing VideoJS players in the browser and gives the user control over playback speed. Useful for online classes where speed controls are often disabled.

## Installation
To install, follow the following procedure:
> 1. Download and unzip the latest source code `.zip` from the releases page.
> 2. Open chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`. Click "developer mode" in the top right.
> 3. Click "load unpacked" in the top left and select the folder you downloaded.

## Usage
> Note: If the extension doesn't show up in your chrome toolbar, click the puzzle icon and "pin" the Speedhook extension.

Clicking the `S` extension icon allows you to choose between several playback speed settings. This will only work on pages with a VideoJS player.
